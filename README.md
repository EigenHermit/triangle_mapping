# triangle_mapping
triangle mapping algorithm to slove the lens equation

The QSOs catalog is not avaiable at github since the filesize is too large.               
I uploaded it through Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U0WKvhNek-PNFY95dJQh1sBr-rtWzv4Y/view?usp=sharing).

Before you use, you need to download the QSO catalog and change the filename in Block2 of main.ipynb         

Enjoy!                                    

If you used this algorithm, please cite this github website.
